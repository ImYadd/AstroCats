# AstroCats: Tales From The Citadel

**Concept:**
The game is inspired by Tales from the Citadel in Rick and Morty and the coding game CodeStrike. Itâ€™s set in a futuristic 2D world where cats have taken over the universe. Players use Python code to help a group of rebel cats fight back against a system that stole their creativity. Why cats as characters ? Simply because we love them. Itâ€™s a fun way to learn programming through a sci-fi story full of humor and action.
